# paskal

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of paskal is to assist performance auditors with some useful calculations related to statistical sampling, including functions to calculate the sample size, the sampling error, or the confidence interval; when estimating the proportion, the mean, or the total through different sampling plans.

## Installation

You can install the development version of paskal from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MrUbi1/paskal")
```

## Example

How many measurements should we make to be 95% confident that the average transaction duration at a government agency is no more than 2 minutes up or down from the true value? We don't know the population standard deviation, but a small pilot sample gave us sd = 6.43 minutes. We can use simple random sampling. A basic code to solve this problem could be as follows:

```{r basic example code}
library(paskal)

# Arguments
C <- 0.95 # Level of confidence
E <- 2 # Sampling error
sd_exp = 6.43 # Expected standard deviation
N = Inf # Population size

# Function
n <- nx_srs(C = C, E = E, sd_exp = sd_exp, N = N) # Call the function

# Output
print(paste("Sample size:",n,"measurements")) # Print the resulting sampling size
```

If you're still unsure if the package is right for you, take a look at the "Intro to paskal" vignette. There you'll find three use cases that demonstrate the full scope of this library.
